This tutorial will guide you through a basic GitHub workflow, including forking a repository, cloning it to your local machine, and adding a remote link for collaboration. This workflow is useful for contributing to open-source projects or collaborating with others on code."

    "Before you get started, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account: You need a GitHub account to fork and interact with repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Git installed: You must have Git installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)."

    "## Forking a Repository\n",
    "Forking a repository creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account, allowing you to work on it without affecting the original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Go to the Repository**: Visit the GitHub repository you want to fork. For example, if you're interested in forking the repository `https://github.com/original-user/repo-name`, go to `https://github.com/original-user/repo-name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the \"Fork\" button in the top-right corner of the repository's page. This action will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account."

    "2. Click the fork button ![Fork](images/fork_repo.png)\n",
    "3. Uncheck the copy the master branch only\n",

    "## Cloning a Repository\n",
    "Cloning a repository means copying it from your GitHub account to your local machine for development.\n",

    "1. **Copy the Repository URL**: On the forked repository page in your GitHub account, click the \"Code\" button, and copy the repository URL (usually in HTTPS or SSH format).\n",
    "![Clone](images/clone_repo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open Your Terminal**: Open your terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory (folder) where you want to store the cloned repository. For example, to clone the repository into a directory called my-project, you can use:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    cd /path/to/your/directory\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    I keep all my repositories in a folder called `github`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clone the Repository**: Use the git clone command to clone the repository. Replace <repository-url> with the URL you copied earlier:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    i.e. `git clone https://github.com/kbrunik/HOPP.git`\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "    i.e. `cd HOPP`\n",

    "## Adding a Remote Link\n",
    "\n",
    "To collaborate or keep your local repository in sync with the original repository, you can add a remote link to the original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add a Remote Link**: Use the git remote add command to add a remote link. Give it a name (usually \"upstream\") and provide the URL to the original repository:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-user/repo-name.git\n",

    "    git remote add upstream https://github.com/NREL/HOPP/git\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Verify the Remote**: To verify that the remote link has been added successfully, you can use:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git remote -v\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This command will display both the origin (your forked repository) and upstream (the original repository) URLs.\n",

    "Now, let's fetch the branches from the original repository, create a new branch, and push it to your remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetch Branches**: Fetch the branches from the original repository so your local Git knows about them. Use the following command, replacing <remote-name> with the name you choose (e.g., \"upstream\"):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git fetch <remote-name>\n",

    "    git fetch upstream\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch based on one of the branches from the original repository. Use the following command to create a new branch and switch to it, replacing <new-branch-name>, <remote-name>, and <remote-branch-name> as needed:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <remote-name>/<remote-branch-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git checkout -b dev/refactor_kb upstream/dev/refactor\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Push New Branch**: Push the new branch to your remote repository (aka your fork). Use the following command:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    For example:\n",
